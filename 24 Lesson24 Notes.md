# Lesson 24 - Adaptive Containers: Stack and Queue
Such containers that internally use another and present a distinct behavior are called *adaptive containers*.

Stacks are LIFO (last-in-first-out) systems where elements can be inserted or removed at the top of the container.  
To use class `std::stack`, include header: `#include <stack>`
