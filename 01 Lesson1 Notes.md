# Lesson 1 - Getting Start
## How To Read 
* **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment.
* **`#include`**: Hash-include, Sharp-include, Pound-include.
* **`std::cout`**: Standard-c-out, `c`- console. 
* **`endl`**: End-line.

## Steps to Generating an Executable
1. Writing (or programming) C++ code using a text editor.
2. Compiling code using a C++ compiler that converts it to a machine language version contained in “object files”.
3. Linking the output of the compiler using a linker to get an executable (.exe in Windows, for example).

## Building and Executing Your First C++ Application
Using Linux:  
`$ g++ -o hello Hello.cpp`  
> This command instructs g++ compiler to create an executable named `hello` by compiling your C++ file `Hello.cpp`.

Then run it with:   
`$ ./hello`


## Do
* **Do** save your files with the `.cpp` extension.
* **Do** use a simple text editor or an Integrated Development Environment to write code.

## Don'T
* **Don’T** use a `.c` extension for your C++ file because some compilers would compile these files as C programs instead of C++. 
* **Don’T** use rich text editors like word processors to write code, because they often add their own markup in addition to the code you program.
