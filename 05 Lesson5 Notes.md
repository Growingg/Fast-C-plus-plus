# Lesson 5 - Working with Expressions, Statements, and Operators

## Statements
All statements in C++ end with a semicolon (;). For examples:  
```c++
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
cout << "Hello \ 
         World" << endl; // split to two lines is OK
```

## Operators
**The Assignment Operator (`=`)**   
```c++
int daysInYear = 365;
```
The assignment operator replaces the value contained by the operand to the left (unimaginatively called l-value) by that on the right (called r-value).
